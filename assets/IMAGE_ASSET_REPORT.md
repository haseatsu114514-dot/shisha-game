# Image Asset Report

This project currently contains placeholder PNGs for Chapter 1 scope.

## Summary
- `sprites/characters`: 26 files (256x512)
- `sprites/faces`: 12 files (64x64)
- `backgrounds`: 12 files (1280x720)
- `ui`: 26 files (category-based sizes)
- Empty PNG files: 0

## What was done
- Picked up all required image file names from the implementation spec.
- Created dummy PNG files for missing/empty image data.
- Added a reusable generator script:
  - `tools/generate_dummy_images.py`

## Notes
- These are development placeholders only.
- Replace with final pixel-art assets while keeping the same file names.
